Now we're going to take a few minutes to revisit three things we've already talked about: mappings, abbreviations, and options, but with a twist. We're going to set each of them in a single buffer at a time.
nnoremap <leader>d dd
nnoremap <buffer> <leader>x dd
nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>x dd
setlocal wrap
setlocal nonumber
set number
set nonumber
nnoremap <buffer> Q x
nnoremap          Q dd
